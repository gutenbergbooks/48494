<span class="i0">One night I went to see her, but she’s gone, the neighbors say,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  The white man bound her with his chain&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i0">They have taken her to Georgia for to wear her life away,</span><br />

</p>

<span class="i0">My canoe is under water, and my banjo is unstrung,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  I’m tired of living any more:</span><br />
<span class="i0">My eyes shall look downward, and my songs shall be unsung</span><br />
<span class="i2">  While I stay on old Kentucky shore.</span><br />
<span class="i4">    Oh, my poor Nelly Gray, &amp;c.</span><br />

<h3>Blind Orphan Boy’s Lament.</h3>
<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They tell me that my mother’s sleeping</span><br />
<span class="i2">  In the church-yard far away,</span><br />
<span class="i0">That she knows not I am weeping&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Weeping all the live long day.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“They tell me that my father’s lying</span><br />
<span class="i2">  In the dark grave by her side;</span><br />
<span class="i0">That I’m left on life’s rough billow</span><br />
<span class="i2">  With no earthly friend or guide.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“When the wild woods echo loudly,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  And the merry songsters sing,</span><br />
<span class="i0">When the winds are hurrying past me</span><br />
<span class="i2">  With sweet music on their wings,</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">“Methinks I hear my mother calling,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  And her grave I long to find;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But there’s no one here to lead me,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  For the orphan boy is blind.”</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He now sleeps within that church-yard</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Where he ofttimes long’d to be;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Angels bore his soul to heaven,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Now the poor blind boy can see.</span><br />

<h3>The Lake-Side Shore.</h3>
<hr class="short" />
<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Summer’s breath is lightly falling</span><br />
<span class="i2">  On the silent waters blue,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the moonbeams bright are sporting</span><br />
<span class="i2">  With the drops of glittering dew;</span><br />
<span class="i0">Hark! away upon the waters</span><br />
<span class="i2">  There’s a sound of dipping oar,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a boat-song loudly chanted,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Echoes down the lake-side shore.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the night-bird’s song comes floating</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Sweetly down the midnight air,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Waking all the depths, to listen</span><br />
<span class="i2">  To the birds that thus should dare</span><br />
<span class="i0">To break the weird and solemn stillness,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  That had reign’d so long before,</span><br />
<span class="i0">In the wood, and mead, and valley,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  On the silent lake-side shore.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now the song comes swelling bolder,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  And the boatman’s chant is heard,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Louder o’er the distant waters,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  As it would outvie the bird;</span><br />
<span class="i0">But each song at last is finish’d,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  And the bird to rest once more,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Leaves no sound to break the quiet</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Of the happy lake-side shore.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who can say there is no pleasure</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Thus to walk the night alone,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Listening to the night-bird’s music,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Or the boatman’s solemn tone?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where is there a spot more lovely,</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Where the vail of night hangs o’er?</span><br />
<span class="i0">Where another place more lovely</span><br />
<span class="i2">  Than this silent lake-side shore?</span><br />

<h3>The Tempest.</h3>
<hr class="short" />
<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">We were crowded in the cabin,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  Not a soul would dare to sleep,</span><br />
<span class="i2">It was midnight on the waters,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  And the storm was o’er the deep</span><br />
<span class="i2">’Tis a fearful thing in winter</span><br />
<span class="i4">  To be shatter’d by the blast,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And to hear the trumpet thunder,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  “Cut away the mast!”</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">We shudder’d there in silence,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  For the stoutest held his breath,</span><br />
<span class="i2">While the hungry sea was roaring,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  And the breakers talk’d with death;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Sad thus we sat in silence,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  All busy with our prayers,</span><br />
<span class="i2">“We’re lost!” the captain shouted,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  As he stagger’d down the stairs.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But his little daughter whisper’d.</span><br />
<span class="i4">  As she took the icy hand,</span><br />
<span class="i2">“Is not God upon the waters,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  Just the same as on the land?”</span><br />
<span class="i2">Then we kiss’d the little maiden,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  And we spake of better cheer,</span><br />
<span class="i2">As we anchor’d safe in harbor,</span><br />
<span class="i4">  Where the sun was shining clear.</span><br />
</p>
<p class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Chorus.</i>&mdash;And a shout rose loud and joyous,</span><br />
<span class="i4">             As we grasp’d the friendly hand,</span><br />
<span class="i4">             God is on the waters,</span><br />
<span class="i4">             Just the same as on the land.</span><br />

<p class="stanza">

<span class="i0">A nation of freemen that moment shall fall,</span><br />

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
